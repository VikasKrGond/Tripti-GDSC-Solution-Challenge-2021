                Food scarcity, hunger, malnutrition is not just a challenge but it is a “War” that we can collectively
                win otherwise defeat leads in the loss of millions of lives. Food is our common ground, a universal
                experience, but do you know? Millions of people don’t even get to experience it.

                Approximately 25 lakh people and 5 lakh animals die due to hunger in India. Millions don’t even know
                whether their next meal is coming from and most of them are children. But the main issue is not hunger,
                it is the unwillingness of our own people to fight against it. This work is not difficult all it takes
                is little efforts from each individual.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                We are more than an organization. We are a family fighting for survival of every member.

                Hunger has become an acute disease in India, but we aim to find solutions not excuses. Together we can
                bring this change if we believe in it.

                Our Vision

                We as a family seek support of our members, be it from India or any corner of the world. Our fight is to
                create a community that for a food sufficient world where nobody sleeps hungry, nobody dies of hunger.

                We aim to connect compassionate and willing people with the people/animals who are in need, also, to
                recycle and regulate the wastage of food.

                The Idea

                We tend to provide food to the needy ones as well as to end the wastage of food that takes place in
                nearly every household with brutal ignorance. Our idea is to collect the food, that would have been
                otherwise wasted, at some “Food Points” (That will be created in required localities depending upon the
                needs) and make it available to children, men, women, street animals.

                Fresh food that would have been wasted goes to people and leftover food (but still edible) goes to
                animals.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It is very simple to become a Hunger Warrior with us. Your very
                willingness is enough for us.

                To create “food points” near you, you need to fill a basic form on our website with the eligibility that
                from your locality at least 5 people are willing to donate food (if not regular then very often at
                least).

                You will be registered on our website and here you'll get daily update of number of food recipients and
                needy ones near you to feed with the help of our very own AI classification model to enhance the
                accuracy of the upcoming demand for the food near you and able to predict the need of creating another
                food point at specific location with the help of google maps and location API's.

                Then also we enabled the method of donating the money to help in buying the goods like-Refrigerator,
                Disposable plates, water outlets and much more in a very transparent mode to ensure that your money is
                getting invested in the right place. In order to optimize the expenses, we'll create a polling system
                based on different locations (4 locations) of the greater need based on the Data and inputs that we are
                getting through various sources and the donated money well be spent in the priority order based on the
                polling.

                You can also register as an independent active volunteer where you don’t necessarily need 5+ people to
                donate but willing to provide 4 hours/week for serving people at food points. </p>
